__Try Node.js Compiler__

https://github.com/pmq20/node-compiler

I have made a new project called node-compiler to compile your Node.js project into one single executable.

It is better than disclose in that it never runs slowly for the first time, since your source code is compiled together with Node.js interpreter, just like the standard Node.js libraries.

Additionally, it redirect file and directory requests transparently to the memory instead of to the file system at runtime. So that no source code is required to run the compiled product.

# Disclose

Pack your Node.js project into an executable without recompiling Node.js.

## Installation

    $ gem install disclose

## Dependencies

Make sure that your system has the following components,

- tar
- gzip
- xxd
- gcc

or on Windows,

- `tar.exe`, which could be installed by [gnuwin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net)
- `gzip.exe`, which could be installed by [gnuwin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net)
- `xxd.exe`, which could be installed by [gvim](http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc)
- `gcc.exe`, which could be installed by [mingw-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64)

The generated executable file is guaranteed to have no external dependencies.

## Usage

    $ disclose [node_path] [project_path]

## Example

On Windows,

    > disclose "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "C:\Users\pmq20\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\coffee-script"

On Unix,

    $ disclose /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/coffee-script

## Hints

* We recommend using `npm3` to generate the `node_modules` folder before packing
